# prologscript

PrologScript is a novel rule-based logic engine designed to function at the heart of self-evolving intelligent systems. It integrates logical inference with probabilistic reasoning and evolutionary optimization, enabling a framework where knowledge structures dynamically refine themselves over time. Unlike traditional AI models that reach performance plateaus and require early stopping, PrologScript allows systems to continuously evolve their understanding of reality and alternate potential realities.
