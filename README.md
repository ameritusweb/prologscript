# prologscript

PrologScript is a JavaScript library bringing the power of logic programming to the web and beyond. Inspired by Prolog, it's designed for exploring cause and effect chains, simulating alternate realities, and performing counterfactual reasoning through logical inference.  Beyond basic Prolog, PrologScript integrates features for agent-based simulation, advanced mathematical computations, symbolic AST manipulation, and even wave function modeling.  Imagine exploring "what if" scenarios using structured knowledge, potentially uncovering insights that traditional Large Language Models might initially miss. Dive in to build rule-based systems, explore knowledge from sources like Wikipedia, and unlock a new dimension of logical exploration in JavaScript.
